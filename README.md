Throughout the tutorial, you will learn how to create the game loop, add images onto the canvas, add click handlers to move the doodler jump and move left and right, apply game physics, randomly generate platforms and move them down the screen, detect collisions between the doodler and each platform, add a running score, and reset the game.
